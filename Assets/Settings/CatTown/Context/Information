-0|Meowton Drugs has been in this town for as long as I can remember. It hasn't changed very much, either.
-1|My mom shopped at Meowton drugs a lot when I was a kitten.
They have more than just drugs and hand creams. They have a lot of cheap food too.
At first I hated to go, so every time we went my mom bought me a candy or a bag of chips. So now I only have fond memories of Meowton drugs.
-2|Meowton drugs is cheap, but the stuff isn't exactly top quality. Wholesome Chews has a bigger grocery department and a pretty good cosmetics department as well, so most people who can afford there buy food and shampoos and things at Wholesome Chews and just use Meowton's to fill out drug prescriptions.
-PWholesome Chews
-0|Wholesome Chews popped up a couple years ago. It's part of an upscale grocery store chain that originated in Whiskerland. I never used to worry about buying local or organic but now that they're here it's hard to stop thinking about.
-1|Wholesome Chews is expensive and pretentious. I feel like boycotting it. Just a few months ago there was a listeria case caused by some soft cheese that someone bought from a Wholesome Chews in Fluff Hollow. They're not perfect, either.
-2|I'm so happy we have a Wholesome Chews here in CatTown. Now I don't have to drive an hour to Fluff Hollow to get local, healthy produce.
