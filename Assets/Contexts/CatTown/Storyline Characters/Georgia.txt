-:Hello
-!*hello*|*hi*|*salutations*|*greetings*
-:How are you?
-!how*you?|*yourself?
-:I'm okay. I went to the doctor yesterday about a rash on my forehead.
-!*what*(he|she|doctor|they)*(prescribe|give|say)*?
-:Dr. Bones told me to put some aloe vera gel on it. He said aloe vera gel
has natural anti inflammatory properties. I like how Bones doesn't prescribe drugs
if he doesn't think it's necessary. But this aloe vera gel is proving very tricky to find.

-?a!*Meowton Drugs*?
-?a:I checked there. They have some moisturizers and hand creams that contain aloe vera, but they're mostly chemicals and dyes. I didn't want to put that stuff on my face.
-?b!*Wholesome Chews*?
-?b:I checked there. They have gels and creams without extra preservatives and such but they're very expensive. I didn't want to spend $20 on a tiny bottle.
-?c:*make*yourself*?
-?c!No, but that's an interesting idea... I'll try that.

<SIDE>
-:*what*(hobbies|do*yesterday|like)*?
-:I don't have too many hobbies. I think that hobbies are kind of a recent invention. Once upon a time, people made their own candles because they had too. Now they call that a hobby. I make my own candles, but I don't consider that a hobby. I don't like buying stuff from the store if I can help it.
